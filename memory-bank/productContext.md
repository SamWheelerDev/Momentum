# Chefy - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

Chefy addresses several key problems in the home cooking space:

1. **Motivation Gap**: Many people want to cook more but struggle with motivation and consistency. Traditional cooking apps focus on recipes but don't address the psychological barriers to regular cooking.

2. **Learning Curve**: Cooking has a steep learning curve that can be intimidating for beginners. Without guidance and encouragement, many give up before developing their skills.

3. **Engagement Challenge**: Recipe apps typically have low retention rates because they lack ongoing engagement mechanisms beyond the initial recipe search.

4. **Personalization Deficit**: Most cooking resources aren't tailored to individual preferences, dietary needs, and skill levels, creating friction in the cooking experience.
