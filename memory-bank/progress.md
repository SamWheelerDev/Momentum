## What Works

### Database Design
- ✅ Core database schema defined with all necessary tables
- ✅ Relationships between entities established
- ✅ UUID primary keys implemented for scalability
- ✅ JSONB columns for flexible data storage
- ✅ Indexes created for performance optimization
- ✅ AI conversation tables added to support the cooking assistant
- ✅ Row Level Security policies implemented for all tables
- ✅ Multi-level visibility for recipes (public, friends, private)
- ✅ User relationships table for friend connections

## What's Left to Build

### Database Implementation

## Current Status

The project is in the early development phase, focusing on establishing the foundational data model. We have completed the database schema design, including the recent addition of AI conversation tables to support the cooking assistant feature.

### Recent Milestones
- Completed initial database schema design
- Added AI conversation tracking capability
- Established entity relationships and constraints
- Created performance optimization indexes
- Implemented comprehensive Row Level Security policies
- Added user relationships for friend-based access control

### Current Sprint Focus
- Finalizing database schema
- Preparing for Supabase deployment
- Planning API layer architecture
- Defining frontend component structure

## Known Issues

### Technical Challenges
1. **Recipe Versioning**: Need to determine how to handle user modifications to recipes
   - Potential solutions: Cloning recipes, storing diffs, or using a version control approach
   - Impact: Medium - affects data model and user experience

2. **AI Integration Complexity**: Integrating the AI assistant with context awareness
   - Potential solutions: Using OpenAI API with context window, custom fine-tuning
   - Impact: High - core feature of the application

3. **Performance Concerns**: Ensuring efficient queries with UUID primary keys
   - Potential solutions: Proper indexing, query optimization, caching strategy
   - Impact: Medium - affects application responsiveness

4. **Data Volume Management**: Handling potentially large conversation history
   - Potential solutions: Archiving old conversations, summarization, pagination
   - Impact: Low - only affects long-term users

5. **RLS Performance Impact**: Ensuring Row Level Security doesn't significantly impact query performance
   - Potential solutions: Careful index design, query optimization, caching strategies
   - Impact: Medium - affects application responsiveness at scale

6. **Friend Relationship Management**: Efficiently handling friend-based access control
   - Potential solutions: Optimized queries, caching friend relationships, background processing
   - Impact: Medium - affects social features and recipe sharing

### Open Questions
1. How to balance XP rewards to maintain user engagement without making progression too easy or too difficult?
2. What is the optimal challenge difficulty curve to keep users engaged but not frustrated?
3. How to implement the meal planning feature to be flexible yet user-friendly?
4. What metrics should we track to measure the effectiveness of the gamification features?
5. How to optimize RLS policies for performance as the database grows?
6. Should we implement more granular permission levels beyond admin/regular user?
