# Chefy - Agentic Workflows Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for implementing agentic workflows in Chefy. These AI-powered workflows will enable personalized, intelligent assistance throughout the user's cooking journey, from recipe selection to meal preparation and skill development.

## Core Principles

1. **User-Centric Design**: All agents are designed around specific user needs identified in our user stories
2. **Progressive Implementation**: Start with foundational capabilities and build complexity incrementally
3. **Feedback Integration**: Design agents to learn from user interactions and improve over time
4. **Modularity**: Create reusable components that can be combined for different workflows

## Technical Implementation

### Agent Architecture

```

│   Agent Coordinator     │
│                         │
│ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ │
│ │ Context │ │Response │ │

┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐
│Specialized│  │Specialized│
│  Agent 1  │  │  Agent 2  │
└──────────┘  └──────────┘
```

1. **Agent Coordinator**
   - Responsible for routing user requests to appropriate specialized agents
   - Maintains conversation context and history
   - Resolves conflicts between agent suggestions
   - Handles fallback responses when specialized agents fail

2. **Context Manager**
   - Tracks user preferences, dietary restrictions, and skill level
   - Maintains cooking state (current recipe, progress, etc.)
   - Stores relevant historical interactions
   - Provides context to agents as needed

3. **Specialized Agents**
   - Recipe Assistant: Handles recipe discovery and selection
   - Cooking Coach: Guides through cooking process
   - Meal Planner: Assists with weekly meal planning
   - Troubleshooter: Helps solve cooking problems
   - Each agent focuses on a specific domain and task

4. **Response Generator**
   - Translates agent outputs into natural language responses
   - Applies consistent tone and personality
   - Formats responses appropriately for different UI contexts
   - Personalizes language based on user preferences

### Data Flow

1. User input is received through UI
2. Agent Coordinator processes input and determines intent
3. Coordinator selects appropriate specialized agent(s)
4. Context Manager provides relevant context to selected agents
5. Specialized agents process request and generate response candidates
6. Coordinator resolves conflicts and selects final response
7. Response Generator formats final response for display
8. UI presents response to user

### Integration with Existing Systems

1. **Database Integration**
   - Agents will read from and write to the existing Supabase database
   - User preferences and history will inform agent decisions
   - Agent interactions will be logged for analysis and improvement

2. **Frontend Integration**
   - Agent responses will be formatted for different UI contexts
   - Interactive elements (buttons, forms, etc.) will be generated as needed
   - Real-time updates will be pushed to UI during ongoing processes

3. **Gamification System Integration**
   - Agents will suggest challenges based on user skill and preferences
   - Achievement opportunities will be identified and suggested
   - XP and level progression will influence agent recommendations

## AI Model Considerations

1. **Model Selection**
   - Core LLM: GPT-4 or equivalent for complex reasoning tasks
   - Specialized models: Consider fine-tuned models for specific tasks
   - Embeddings: For efficient recipe and ingredient similarity search

2. **Prompt Engineering**
   - System prompts will define agent roles and constraints
   - Few-shot examples will guide consistent responses
   - Structured output formats will ensure parseable responses
   - Context window management will be critical for efficiency

3. **Local vs. API Integration**
   - Initial implementation: API-based using OpenAI or equivalent
   - Future consideration: Evaluate smaller models for edge deployment
   - Hybrid approach: Simple tasks local, complex tasks via API

## Implementation Challenges and Mitigations

1. **Challenge**: Context window limitations
   - **Mitigation**: Implement efficient context summarization and selective inclusion

2. **Challenge**: Ensuring factual accuracy in cooking advice
   - **Mitigation**: Ground responses in vetted recipe database, implement citation system

3. **Challenge**: Handling ambiguous user requests
   - **Mitigation**: Implement clarification workflows with suggested options

4. **Challenge**: Managing latency for real-time cooking assistance
   - **Mitigation**: Precompute likely questions/issues for active recipes, implement streaming responses

5. **Challenge**: Avoiding repetitive or generic advice
   - **Mitigation**: Track previously given advice, implement diversity in response generation

## Success Metrics

1. **User Engagement**
   - Frequency of agent interactions
   - Completion rate of agent-suggested tasks
   - User ratings of agent helpfulness

2. **Learning Performance**
   - Improvement in agent accuracy over time
   - Reduction in clarification requests
   - Increase in successful task completions

3. **Business Impact**
